###NewRelic Advantage:
####1.Application Response Times:
The application response time is an average of the total time spent, across all web transactions occurring during a selected time frame, on the server-side. In the application overview the time spent in the app server is broken down into different layers including, request queuing, database, caching, application code, external calls and more.

####2.Transaction Breakdown:
Receive performance details of each segment including % time, average calls per transaction, and average time.

####3.Access to Performance Data API:
Create customized queries on metric names and metric data, including application server response times, page load times, and number of transactions and page loads. Also receive data about error rates and application server performance.

####4.Time Spent in Database Calls:
The database overview provides a stack ranking of the most time consuming database calls along with aggregated metrics around response times and throughput and slow SQL traces.

####5.Slow SQL Report:
Slow SQL samples are examples of the worst performing SQL on your site. Along with the SQL, New Relic collects the context and diagnostic information you need to fix your database performance issues.

####6.SQL Query Analysis:
Track the exact SQL statements that are slowing down your site. Get samples of the worst performing SQL and stack traces to understand exactly where the SQL is used in your code, and how to fix it.

####7.Availability & Error Monitoring:
Alerting enables you to set your own warning and critical thresholds so you can stay on top of finding and resolving problems quickly, and collaboration allows you to easily share problems/solutions with your team members.
New Relic uses an external pinger to verify your customers can reach your site. The pinger service verifies application availability by making requests to them regularly, recording errors, and sending downtime alerts when an application is down.

####8.Reports:
Create and receive customized reports that are just as easy to read as they are to share. Our detailed reports include everything from deployments and availability, to app speed index and customized dashboards.

*App Speed Index: Every day soon after 1600 hours UTC, New Relic's Application Speed Index refreshes the data and shows the day's rankings as well as historical information for the past 30 days. This includes percentiles for end user speed, app speed, error rate, and availability.

*Deployments: Your Deployments dashboard lists recent deployments and their impact on your end user and app server's Apdex scores, response times, throughput, and errors. You can view and drill down details, use search and sort options, hide or delete the error, share it with others, or file a ticket about it.

*Capacity:New Relic APM's Capacity analysis report shows how many instances of your app are running and how busy they are. This information is useful to analyze whether your app has enough instances deployed to support request loads. You can then use this information to fine-tune your configuration for optimal performance.

*Host USage: The APM Host Usage Report provides a clear view into the unique hosts and applications that have connected to New Relic during a specified time window. Host usage reporting provides details on which applications and accounts each host was used by on an hourly basis.

*Custom dashboards: 

*SLA: View daily, weekly, or monthly SLA reports showing graphical trends over selected time periods, to better understand where application performance is heading. 

####Team Collaboration: 
APM tools make it easy for DevOps teams to collaborate, share, and work together to solve problems such as HipChat, Jira etc.

####Security:
Secure by Default
Configurable Security
For customers with very high security needs, we have recently added an Enterprise Security Mode that lets you lock down the available security options so that your own employees can't accidentally enable the transmission of sensitive data.
